# d'Graph
### Version 0.2.1

---

### What is this?

d'Graph is an efficacious graphing tool that cooperates well with AWS Cloud Systems (EC2). The equanimous, circular graphs, introduced by the application, present a vastly more readable approach to the Cloud interconnections; allow to preview certain instances, subnets and security groups. 

#### Features

- Connect, inspect and generate Cloud dependency map - with a **single command**.
- Browse and compare **multiple VPC**s
- Print the graphs on **paper**

---

### Requirements

There are some limpid prerequisites for d'Graph. Make sure you check them out before launching the script, otherwise the script will be mean, tell you step-by-step what you are missing and hurt your feelings.

- **NodeJS** and NPM installed ( http://nodejs.org )
- **GulpJS** installed ( http://goo.gl/RxXrpe ) ( If you won't be able to insstall it, the script will)
- **Internet browser** capable of browsing the Internet

### Running

First, **fetch the whole project** from the GitHub.

Second, **fulfill** the requirements.

At last, run **dGraph.sh** ( preferably with sudo ).

```
sh dGraph.sh --sudo
```

This will launch the whole project building. **Just give it a sec.** After that second, the tool will open a browser and it is ready to go.
